        <p> Value to which the RevPi output pin is manually set.</p>


<h2>Details</h2>
  <p>The output-node can output a value at an output pin of the RevPi. 
  The pin is defined in the options. The value to be output is also defined in the options or selected by the input of the node. In both cases the node is triggered by the incoming message at the input port.</p>

  <p>To be able to select the pins, the node must be connected to the RevPi. The address of the RevPi is entered under the field Server.
  If the Node Red environment is running on the RevPi, localhost or 127.0.0.1 and port 8000 can be used.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>
  <p>The multiple-input-node can read one or more values from the RevPi input pins. 
  The values are initially output after a deploy at the output port of the node. 
  After that a Json string, which contains all values of the pins, is sent on the output port of the node whenever a value is changed at the selected pins.</p>

  <p>To be able to select the pins, the node must be connected to the RevPi. The address of the RevPi is entered under Server.
  If the Node Red environment is running on the RevPi, localhost or 127.0.0.1 and port 8000 can be used.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>
  <p>To be able to select the inputs and outputs of the RevPi, the node must be connected to the RevPi.<p></p>
  Usually Node-Red is installed on the RevPi, therefore the local address can be used in connection with port 8000.
